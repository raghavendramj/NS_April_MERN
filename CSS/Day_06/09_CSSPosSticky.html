      online platforms to tackle illegal content. "It will be up to Twitter to
      adapt themselves ... to our rules," Thierry Breton told Reuters and one
      other media outlet on the deal sealed by Tesla's chief executive to buy
      Twitter Inc. for $44 billion. "I think Elon Musk knows Europe very well.
      He knows very well that we have some rules for the automotive industry ...
      and he understands that. So in Europe, in order to protect freedom of
      speech and to protect individuals, any companies will have to fulfill this
      obligation." "I think Elon Musk knows Europe very well. He knows very well
