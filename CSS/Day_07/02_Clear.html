    <h2>Without Clear</h2>
    <div class="div1">Div1</div>
    <div class="div2">
      Div2 Mitchell Marsh has come out with a licence to go after everything,
      especially when the debutant is feeling his way into the IPL. He hits two
      and four off the first two balls from Harshit Rana, but then the third one
      swings in a little, making him hit to leg (the previous hits had been
      straight). Marsh has nailed this one, but he has picked out the only deep
      fielder on the leg side, the deep backward square leg. It's 17 for 2 in
      1.3 overs. DC still 69% favourites to win.
